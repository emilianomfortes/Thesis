# Master's Thesis in Physics

## WARNING
This repository contains part of the codes I used during my Master's thesis in Physics, and its original purpose was sharing such parts with my advisor and teammates. It is neither clean nor bug-free, and it should not be considered a portfolio. The repository has been transferred from my old GitHub account onto this new one on December 2020. The complete, bug-free versions of this repository will be kept private between my advisor's laboratory for the time being. If you still decide to use them, exercise caution. 

## Description
I worked simulating spin 1/2 chains system to study quantum chaotic behaviour using direct diagonalization. The codes I've used have had it's a fair share of Fortran, Julia and Python. They were used during my Master's thesis and are the pillar stone of the results published in the following two papers. 

1) <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.042201">Gauging classical and quantum integrability through out-of-time-ordered correlators </a>

2) <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/130/60001">Signatures of quantum chaos transition in short spin chains
</a>
